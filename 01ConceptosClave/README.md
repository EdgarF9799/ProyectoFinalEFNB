Introduction.

The dataset "heart.csv" deals with the study of heart attacks, through a study carried out on 303 individuals and using various variables, such as age, gender, triglycerides, cholesterol and height, among others. This study carried out not only shows the complexity of cardiovascular health by uniting certain variables that allow recognizing heart attacks, but also offers a perspective of preventing heart disease and promoting a better quality of life. Among the most important variables, we found that age and gender are crucial factors influencing heart health. As we age, the structures and functions of the heart can change, increasing the risk of heart disease. On the other hand, there are studies that have shown that there are differences in the way men and women experience and develop cardiovascular diseases. Understanding these variations is essential to offer an effective and personalized approach to care.

The dataset makes it possible to correlate different variables, which, although they have already been identified in isolated or independent ways as prone variables for a person to suffer heart attacks, the complete set would help to understand or predict whether a person is prone to a heart attack, for example. Give some examples of relationship:

Triglyceride and cholesterol levels are critical indicators of heart health, high levels of these lipids in the blood can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease.

In summary, the detailed study of the heart, integrating factors such as age, gender, triglycerides, cholesterol, height and others, plays an essential role in the prevention and treatment of heart disease. By considering these key variables, healthcare professionals can personalize care, make informed decisions, and promote a holistic approach to ensuring cardiovascular health throughout life.

Work done (Notebooks)

Most of the notebooks are descriptive statistics, which show the composition of the Dataset and many give a proposal for a simple regression model with a percentage of precision.


There are some quite good solutions proposed, that although it would be necessary to put them into practice, the models play with the different variables to outline and predict the clinical health of the patient, below I share the Notebook that I consider worth reviewing.

Notebook Name: heart-attack-prediction-multi-votingclassifier.ipynb

This Notebook contains the integration of machine learning in cardiovascular disease prediction and management has the potential to make a profound impact on global health. By harnessing the power of data and advanced algorithms, we can work towards reducing the burden of CVDs, saving lives, and improving the overall quality of life for millions of individuals around the world. However, it is important to emphasize the need for ongoing research, validation, and responsible implementation to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of these machine learning models in real-world clinical settings.

The main objective of this Machine Learning project, using a heart attack dataset, is to develop and train accurate predictive models that can identify patterns and risk factors related to the occurrence of heart attacks.

1) Definition of the Problem:
Heart attack classification: The central focus will be the classification of patients into high and low risk categories for heart attack, using a supervised learning approach.

2) Measurable Objectives:
Develop multiple models: Create and evaluate various classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, among others, to identify which one offers the best predictive performance.

3) Success Metrics:
Accuracy and Recall: Evaluate models based on metrics such as accuracy and recall to determine their ability to accurately predict heart attacks and capture positive cases.


4) Data Preparation:
Cleanup and Transformation: Perform an exhaustive dataset cleanup and preprocessing process, including outlier management, missing data imputation, and variable normalization.

5) Feature Selection:
Identify Relevant Variables: Perform a feature importance analysis to determine which variables have the greatest impact on predicting heart attacks.

6) Cross Validation:
Robust Evaluation: Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that models are able to adequately generalize to new data and minimize overfitting.

7) Implementation and Deployment:
User Interface: Create a simple interface that allows healthcare professionals to enter patient data and obtain a heart attack risk prediction.

8) Documentation and Communication:
Technical Reports and Presentations: Generate detailed technical reports that describe the development process of the models, the results obtained and the recommendations based on the findings. Also, prepare presentations to effectively communicate results to stakeholders.

At the end of this project, the goal is to achieve reliable and useful Machine Learning models that can be used as tools to identify and assess the risk of heart attacks in patients. This approach aligns with Machine Learning project scoping best practices and aims to offer a valuable contribution to the field of cardiovascular health.
