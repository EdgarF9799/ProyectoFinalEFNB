# ProyectoFinalEFNB
In this repository you will find the first installment of the MLOPS  Project
The structure of the folders was made according to the evaluation criteria, the points were made as requested, however, there were some points in the delivery which I am going to investigate to improve the delivery (it was the case of the " API").

1) Key concepts:
>Definition of the baseline and scope of the project: In the following link is the DataSet that corresponds to me "Heart", which contains all the necessary information

https://github.com/EdgarF9799/ProyectoFinalEFNB/blob/main/01ConceptosClave/Readme.txt


>Notebook: This notebook was worked from GoogleColab and processed in VisualStudioCode, it was taken from the Kagle source and integrated some others, in the Notebook are the descriptive part of the DataSet, descriptive statistics and the prediction models that are requested in points later.

2) Basic concepts and tools for software development

>Virtual Environments: The steps are placed to create a virtual environment in Windows and Linux. In the same way, in another file the steps for Tox and Poetry are integrated

> Continuous use of GitHub: Although my activity on GitHub is not much, this is because I work almost everything locally, this is because in my area where I work "Collection", we are not allowed access by computer equipment, nor install programs other than those of the Bank, so it is difficult for me to work with the dynamism that the class requests.


> Unit tests: the 4 files are integrated with the code for unit tests.

>Pre-Commits: the pre-commits are placed in a "yaml" file to make the 4 requested validations:

3) Development of ML models, for this specific point I had some problems with the code, however, I will upload what I do, in a

> Refactoring: I upload the Notebook with the refactoring and the requested code for my dataset

https://github.com/EdgarF9799/ProyectoFinalEFNB/blob/main/03DesarrolloModelosML/refactorizacion_efnb.py


>Rest Appi: for this specific point I had some problems with the code, however, I upload the base structure.
